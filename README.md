# powerBI_Dashboard
Hello Reader, 
This is my repository over Github containing a Project on Sales Data (Madhav E-Commerce) an online store using PowerBI and Excel to analyze different Data:
1> State wise Order data
2> Payment Mode wise order Data (online/Cash/UPI/Credit Card etc.)
3> Profit by Month, Quarter etc.
4> Average Quantity sold etc.

I've used different inbuilt graphs for visuals:
>> Stacked Column Chart
>> Area Chart
>> Donut Chart
>> Slicer etc.
